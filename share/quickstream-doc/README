Running make with write to ../../quickstream.doc/

This directory contains files that generate documentation files that go
into https://github.com/lanceman2/quickstream.doc.git.  You see we do not
want to check-in generated files into
https://github.com/lanceman2/quickstream.git.  We put the generated file
from this directory into https://github.com/lanceman2/quickstream.doc.git
and so https://github.com/lanceman2/quickstream.doc.git is not used like a
repository, but is a dumping ground so that we can document quickstream on
the web via github.com service.
