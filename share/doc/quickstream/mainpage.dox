\section intro What is quickstream?

quickstream is a run library with application programming interfaces
(API), some filter plugin modules, and some utility programs.  quickstream
is written in C and the libraries can link with C and C++ code.
quickstream is for building flow stream graphs that process data in filter
module stages.  quickstream is light-weight and fast.
