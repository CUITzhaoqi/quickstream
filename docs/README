Running make with write to ../../fastream.doc/

This directory contains files that generate documentation files that go
into https://github.com/lanceman2/faststream.doc.git.  You see we do not
want to check-in generated files into
https://github.com/lanceman2/faststream.git.  We put the generated file
from this directory into https://github.com/lanceman2/faststream.doc.git
and so https://github.com/lanceman2/faststream.doc.git is not used like a
repository, but is a dumping ground so that we can document faststream on
the web via github.com service.
