// This file contains inline functions that move struct QsJobs (jobs) from
// one list to another.  It shows how the jobs flow through different
// lists, be they queues, stacks, or single element pointers.
//
// These lists of jobs and the "flow of jobs" between them allow us to
// have the effect of threads flowing through the quickstream filter flow
// graph.  That is what makes quickstream interesting, fast, and a
// self-optimising stream framework.  The other stream frameworks have
// threads fixed to their filters, and so the threads do not flow.  There
// are so many reasons why that is not optimal.  One can show that that
// will not be optimal unless the filter loads are balanced.
// quickstream automatically balances the thread time to filter "load"
// ratio.  Puts simply, worker threads are free to work where work is
// needed; they are not bound to one filter.


//  See the "job flow graph" by running (bash command-line):
//
//
//        display ../share/doc/quickstream/jobFlow.dot
//
//
//
// Notice in the "job flow graph" there are 4 lines connecting 4 types of
// job lists.  That gives us 4 possible transfer C functions, but we need
// only 3, because the 2 transfers 'filter stage' -> 'stream queue' and
// 'filter unused' -> 'filter stage' always happen at the same time.  The
// filter unused and the filter stage really act as one list, with the
// stage job being a special element in that list.
//
//
// So ya, there are 3 job list transfer functions are in this file.



// Holding the stream mutex lock is required for all 3 job list transfer
// functions.


// The order that the working threads traverse the stream filter graph is
// something that could be variable and very important.

// By writing this code in a somewhat agile matter, it would appear that
// we have found that these job lists are an emergent propriety of the
// code.  We only required that the threads be able to move from one
// filter to the next, that we use no allocations as the working threads
// moved from filter to filter, and the code and data structures be
// minimal.



// 1. Transfer job from the filter->stage to the stream job queue, then
//
// 2. transfer a job from filter unused to filter stage (to replace the
//    one you just moved), and then
//
// 3. clean the filter stage job args.
//
//
// Steps 2. and 3. are the "AndSoOn" part of the function name.
//
// The filter stage is a queue of one.
//
// This is first called by the master thread with all the source filters.
// It is also called by worker threads to queue jobs in the order that
// the working threads traverse the stream filter graph.
//
// We must have a stream->mutex lock to call this.
