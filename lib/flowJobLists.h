// This file contains inline functions that move struct QsJobs (jobs) from
// one list to another.  It shows how the jobs flow through different
// lists, be they queues, stacks, or single element pointers.
//
// These lists of jobs and the "flow of jobs" between them allow us to
// have the effect of threads flowing through the quickstream filter flow
// graph.  That is what makes quickstream interesting, fast, and a
// self-optimising stream framework.  The other stream frameworks have
// threads fixed to their filters, and so the threads do not flow.  There
// are so many reasons why that is not optimal.  One can show that that
// will not be optimal unless the filter loads are balanced.
// quickstream automatically balances the thread time to filter "load"
// ratio.  Puts simply, worker threads are free to work where work is
// needed; they are not bound to one filter.


//  See the "job flow graph" by running (bash command-line):
//
//
//        display ../share/doc/quickstream/jobFlow.dot
//
//
// In addition to the 3 job transfers shown in the above image, we
// sometimes at the end of a quickstream flow cycle will need to move jobs
// from the stream job queue back to the filter's unused stack, because
// a filters stops receiving data.  So we have for job (struct QsJob)
// transfer functions in this file.


// Holding the stream mutex lock is required for all 4 of these job list
// transfer functions.


// The order that the working threads traverse the stream filter graph is
// something that could be variable and very important.

// By writing this code in a somewhat agile manner, it would appear that
// we have found that these job lists are an emergent propriety of the
// code.  We only required that the threads be able to move from one
// filter to the next, that we use no allocations as the working threads
// move from filter to filter, and the code and data structures be
// minimal.



// This removes a job from the stream job queue and puts it in the filter
// unused job stack.  It's used to clear jobs out of order, because the
// filter has stopped having it's input() called.  The job must exist in
// the stream job queue.
//
//  1. Remove job from stream job queue.
//
//  2. Put the job into the filter unused job stack.
//
// This is an unusual job list transfer function that only happens when a
// filter module finishes running unexpectedly and so we need to remove
// queued up jobs from the list that stream job queue that feeds worker
// threads.  This case is not shown on the "job flow graph".  Just think
// of it as a filter going into a stopped state, and some of the input
// data at the end in the remaining queued jobs is discarded.
//
// We must have a stream->mutex lock to call this.
