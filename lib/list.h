// It would appear that all (most) the implementations of things like red
// black trees, singly and doubly linked lists, and other generic lists,
// use an allocation that is separate from the allocation of the element
// that is being stored.  So to make and add and element you must do two
// separate allocations one for the element and one for the list pointers.
// That seems wasteful to me.  If the element being stored has the list
// data structure in it, then we can add an element with just one
// allocation.  This is an obvious optimization.  We also get one less
// layer of pointer indirection when we get the element from the list, and
// we get the element typed at compile time, and do not access another
// pointer.
//
// For lists in quickstream, we insist that the access to the list be
// quick when the stream is in a "run" state, and the lists are not edited
// while it is in a "run" state.
//
// Arrays may be the quickest list data structure that there is, and
// quicker than a hash table, given that we do not calculate a hash
// function to index into the table.


//
// TODO: Maybe make this into a red black tree with the same interfaces.
// They maybe needed when lookup by name string is needed by (filter API)
// user code.
