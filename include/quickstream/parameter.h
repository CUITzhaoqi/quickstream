 *
 * quickstream manages two kinds of data:
 *
 *   1. stream data that is quickly flowing between filters in the stream,
 *      and the rate at which data flows is relatively large compared to
 *   2. control parameter data that is changing relatively slowly.  The
 *      size of the data in the parameter must be small, so that it may be
 *      copied to be passed to other threads to be used.
 *
 * We generally avoid directly copying stream data, and we usually copy
 * parameters.  If a parameter changes at the rate of stream data than it
 * should not be a parameter, and it should be stream data, and the
 * filter flow graph should be re-engineered.
 *
 * The parameter data is shared between filters and external entities
 * called controllers.  An obvious example control parameter would be a
 * sound volume level on a sound channel.  The parameter could just be a
 * single number factor that multiples an input stream channel to give an
 * output stream channel.  For such a volume filter, using a
 * "pass-through" buffer would be best and so no copying of the stream
 * data would be required, it would just multiple it as it was passed
 * through from the input port to the output port using the same ring
 * buffer for input and output.
 *
 * Any parameter is owned by either a filter or a controller.  When the
 * owning filter or controller are destroyed, so is the parameter.  That's
 * just how we define owner of a parameter.
 *
 * Some parameters may not be requested to be set by code that is not the
 * owner.  This kind of parameter just ignores set requests bye not having
 * a setCallback, or having a setCallback that does not use the value
 * passed in to set the value.  A good example of such a parameter is
 * filter through-put, which you would want to be set by something that
 * is not measuring the through-put.
 *
 * This parameter API is an synchronous API that enables non-blocking
 * inter-filter and controller-filter communication, so long as the user
 * does not use callback functions that block.  A controller is a code
 * that can access this API and is not a filter module.
 *
 * Of course the use of the quickstream control parameter thingy is not
 * required, and a user can make their own "control parameter" thingy.
 * But the benefit of using it is that you take advantage of controller
 * modules that can extend parameters to have additional interfaces like
 * for example making the parameters readable and writable from a web app
 * page, without the filter writer needing to write any browser client or
 * server code.  So if a filter has implemented a quickstream parameter,
 * that parameter can then be controlled from all the quickstream
 * controllers that are available without knowing about said
 * controllers.
 *
 * Parameter passed between entities with the callback in this API are
 * intended to be copied in the callbacks.  So ya, the parameters must be
 * small, like two floats; hence stack memory can be used for passing the
 * value, and it can be copied to local object state from there without
 * mutexes-n-shit.  You may need mutexes for your local object state, but
 * not for the passed parameter values.
 *
 * The cost is this butt ugly parameter interface, these 6 functions; and
 * the benefit is seamlessly extending the controlling of parameters to a
 * library of controllers.  Such a paradigm is helpful in constructing the
 * Internet of Things (IoT).
 *
 * The parameters are small and copied between threads that are running
 * different codes, so copying them in callback functions is straight
 * forward and acceptable way to pass they between these independent
 * computations.
 *
 * Past parameter values are not queued, or stored by quickstream.  They
 * are not time stamped.  They do not have a sample rate.  It's up to the
 * filter or controller module writer to add that kind of thing, if it is
 * needed.
 *
 * Parameters cannot be added or removed while the stream is flowing.
 *
 *  \todo examples linked here.

/** qsParameterCreate() is called in a filter in construct() or in
 * a controller module to create a parameter
 *
 * In general the filter or controller must exist for the parameter to
 * exist, because the state of the parameter is not necessarily just the
 * value of a variable, but can be defined by a complex algorithm.
 *
 * \param pName is the name of the parameter.  This name only needs to be
 * unique to the filter module.
 *
 * \param type is the parameter type.  type tells you how to deal with the
 * \p value.
 *
 * \param setCallback is a function that is called when qsParameterSet()
 * is called in by another entity possibly in a different thread than one
 * used to call the filter input().  setCallback() will most likely be
 * called in a different thread than the filter's input() function thread.
 * So steps must be taken by the user to keep data consistent between
 * these different threads.  In the simplest case just atomically copying
 * the data to another variable in the setCallback.
 *
 * Calling setCallback() should not block.  If there is a blocking call
 * required it should queue up the request, and act later. This
 * qsParameter class does not provide queuing of set requests, all the
 * functions just call the callbacks while keeping it ordered and
 * synchronous, and if the user needs queuing the user can add it on top
 * of this interface without much work.   If setCallback() does block
 * quickstream will not brake, but it may become slowstream.
 *
 * \param cleanup is a clean-up function that is called to do things like
 * free memory associated with the parameter after the parameter is no
 * longer needed.  \p cleanup may be 0 if no clean-up is needed.
 *
 * Parameters are destroyed when the owning filter or controller is
 * unloaded, and \p cleanup() is called.
 *
 * \param userData is passed to the setCallback() function every time it
 * is called.
 *
 * The \p value pointer will point to memory that is not owned by the
 * filter that is calling this function.  The memory should likely be
 * copied.
 *
 * The stream and filter name are not needed as parameters because the
 * filter module knows it's stream and filter name.
 *
 * \return 0 on success and 1 if the parameter already exists.
 * returns -1 if the filter or controller module is not found.
