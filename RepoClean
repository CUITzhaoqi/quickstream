    Usage: $0 [-x]

    Remove generated files; that's all files that are not checked into
    a repository.  This will not remove users files that are not built
    from the scripts here in.  So ya, this will not delete your notes,
    assuming you don't put them in a autotools .lib/ directory or
    something like that.

    If you wish to remove files needed to bring this source to a fresh
    tarball state run "make distclean".


         OPTIONS

       -x    remove the automatically downloaded file quickbuild.make
             and package.make too.

# The extra clean option.  quickbuild.make is downloaded.

# We don't remove it by default, without the -x extra clean command-line
# option.  package.make is generated from running the "quickbuild"
